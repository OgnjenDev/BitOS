# BitOSOS

BitOS is a lightweight, bootable operating system designed to provide a minimal environment with a simple shell and basic filesystem support. It boots directly from an ISO image using the GRUB bootloader.

## Features

- Bootable ISO image
- GRUB bootloader integration
- Minimal shell for basic command execution
- Simple filesystem support

## Getting Started

### Requirements

- A computer capable of booting from USB or CD/DVD
- ISO burning software (e.g., Rufus, Etcher) or virtual machine software

### Installation / Booting

1. Download the BitOS github repo.
2. In linux run make all and build.sh you will get a ISO file.
3. Burn the ISO on a USB or use a virtual machine.
4. The GRUB bootloader will load and start BitOS.
5. You will be presented with a minimal shell prompt.

## Usage

Once booted, you can use the minimal shell to interact with the filesystem and execute basic commands.

## File System

BitOS supports a simple filesystem that allows basic file operations such as reading and writing files.

## Development

This project is intended for educational purposes and as a foundation for further OS development.
